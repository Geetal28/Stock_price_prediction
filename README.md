# Stock_price_prediction
Developed a stock price forecasting framework for Apple Inc. using both traditional and deep learning models. Implemented Linear Regression, LSTM, and a Stacking Ensemble with XGBoost, achieving improved accuracy and robustness in predictions. Demonstrated the effectiveness of combining ML and DL for financial time series forecasting.

🎯 Objectives

- Demonstrate how technical indicators and feature engineering improve forecasts
- Build baseline models using Linear Regression and LSTM
- Tune hyperparameters of LSTM for better performance
- Combine models using ensemble stacking
- Evaluate results using MSE and RMSE metrics

🧰 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy – data handling
- Matplotlib / Seaborn – visualization
- Scikit-learn – ML models & preprocessing
- TensorFlow / Keras – Deep Learning models (LSTM, etc.)
- XGBoost 
- Decision tree(Ensemble)

📈 Data Source
- Yahoo Finance API (via yfinance)
- Historical stock data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from 1995–present.

## The project covers the full lifecycle — data collection → feature engineering → modelling → evaluation → visualization.
